# GreenLab
For the VU Green Lab course

## Factors:
- HPC library
- Regular library
## Treatments:
- 3 regular libraries (w/ randomization = 1)
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- 4 HPC libraries (w/ randomization = 1)
  - Vaex
  - Modin
  - Polars
  - Das
## Subjects:
  - 5 memory-bound
  - 5 compute-bound
## Metrics
- Energy consumed (J)
- Performance (s))

## Roughly:
1 * 1 * 10 = 10 experiments

30 takes -> 10*30 = 300

2 min. between = 600 min.

2 sec. per take = 5 min.

â€”> 10 hours

10 <<< 35h we should aim for

Note: Not every library might be able to perform a certain operation) We should think of the treatment assignment tables
